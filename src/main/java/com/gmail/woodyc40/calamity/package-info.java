 * <p>The majority of the surface-level logic is handled by

 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.gmail.woodyc40.calamity.CalamityBuf}
 *     <li>{@link com.gmail.woodyc40.calamity.CalamityBufImpl}</li>
 *     <li>{@link com.gmail.woodyc40.calamity.CalamityOptions}</li>
 * </ul></p>

 * <p>Developers looking to use the Calamity buffers API
 * should begin here and use the Calamity buffer with the

 *
 * <p>As Calamity buffers is an API built upon components,
 * other packages may of interest to developers looking to
 * extend upon, improve, or customize the buffer.</p>
