/**
 * Byte storage component.
 *
 * <p>Classes that are used to define logic for storing
 * bytes contained by the buffer are included in this
 * package.</p>
 *
 * <p>To allow a greater degree of flexibility, the byte
 * storage component allows developers to create their own
 * byte sinks and implement such features as memory pooling
 * and specialized linked memory sectors in order to tune
 * the buffer to their specific needs.</p>
